    The areas page presents a more detailed overview of Edinburgh's key
    neighbourhoods.  Each section groups together several areas and
    includes a short description of what makes them unique.  Visitors
    can click through to the Browse page pre‑filtered by area to
    discover restaurants and cafés in that part of the city.  The
    layout retains the same sidebar navigation and header as the
    other pages for a consistent experience.

          Edinburgh is a city of distinct neighbourhoods, each with its own history and
          character.  From the cobbled streets of the Old Town and the Georgian avenues
          of the New Town to the seaside promenade of Portobello and the leafy suburbs
          of Morningside and Marchmont, there is something for every taste.  The city
          council also divides Edinburgh into four administrative localities (North
          East, North West, South West and South East) which collectively encompass
          these districts.  Select an area below to browse dining options in that
          neighbourhood.
